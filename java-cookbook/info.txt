CLASSPATH is a list of class files in any of a number of directories, JAR files, or ZIP files. Just 
  like the PATH your system uses for finding programs, the CLASSPATH is used by the Java runtime to 
  find classes. Even when you type something as simple as java HelloWorld, the Java interpreter 
  looks in each of the places named in your CLASSPATH until it finds a match.
